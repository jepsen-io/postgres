# jepsen.postgres

Jepsen tests for the Postgres database system.

## Usage

To check Postgres `SERIALIZABLE`, try

```
lein run test-all --node n1 -w append --concurrency 50 --isolation serializable --nemesis none --time-limit 120 -r 200 --test-count 2 --max-writes-per-key 1
```

If you have a postgres process on localhost, with a postgres user (and
database) named `jepsen`, and password `pw`, try:

```
lein run test-all -w append --max-writes-per-key 4 --concurrency 50 -r 500 --isolation serializable --time-limit 60 --nemesis none --existing-postgres --node localhost --no-ssh --postgres-user jepsen --postgres-password pw
```
